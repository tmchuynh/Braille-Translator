The code is used to search for the word "success" in a text input field. The code above uses the onkeyup event to check if the word "success" has been entered and then change it to lowercase.

The code starts by checking if the key pressed is the backspace key. If it is, it will remove the last child of the display section. The code then checks to see if that was a backspace or a spacebar. If it was a spacebar, then this means that there are no more children in this section and so we can stop looping through them. The else statement handles what happens when you press enter on your keyboard instead of pressing backspace or space bar. This next part loops through all of the images in our input and displays them one at a time until we get to an image with no more children left in its parent section (the first image).

The code is checking if the key pressed is the backspace key. If it is, it will remove the last child of the display section. The code above is responsible for displaying the images. It is looping through the input and displaying them on screen in order to show how many there are.
